Oct. 9th Brick Lane

Dear Boss,

Very quiet lately, been sharpen-ing my knife, you will hear of me next Saturday night with my funny game's again at Silvertown or very likely before, no doubt on Friday night, I mean to Rip up two girls that work at Silver's, I have watched them this last week, curse the ink
its Fell over it has gone pale. You have not caught me yet. I have been in Whitechapel all the while. You can offer all the reward you like but you wont catch me next two girls I will fetch their Hearts to the Police Station and lay them on the step of Leman Street Station.

No doubt you have been on the watch for me

No more at present

Jack the Ripper
