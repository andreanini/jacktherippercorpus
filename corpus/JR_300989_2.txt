Beware I am near

Jack the Ripper

The police are bust looking for me I'm like a monkey up a tree not to be found as you will see While there is work for rippers three

This is the ninth murder we have done Yet it seems we have not begun

But now the Evenings are getting dark With the loose Girls we'll rip up

Not time for more Too Busy for more now -
