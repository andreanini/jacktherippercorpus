The prositues I promised Kelly it 2/6 for to have A [smudged word] Fuck & she gave a Little scream but I act quickly by putting a chop in neck the Dear old knife who committed these murders is down the thames  If Government will give me A Free Pardon I shall give myself up [previous in black ink, following in pencil] no, after doing twenty I tried to do one last week but was prevented
