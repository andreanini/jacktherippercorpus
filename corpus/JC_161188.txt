To the Supt,

I know you are looking for me everywhere but will never find me. I am chiefly in Hampstead Rd & Tottinham court Rd. Why I passed a Policeman yesterday & he didnt take no notice of me. Its no use you putting up those bills you wont find no partner. I'm on the right side I do it by myself. Im not in any fishing smacks as you call them Im a private Gentleman. Look out for me on
Saturday I Intend to do some more murders. No one wont get no 1 000 pounds.

I live in George St. very comfortable. Im 30 years old tall & dark [ ] if you cant find me your a lot of fools.

Yours Truly
