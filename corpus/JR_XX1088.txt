Honorably Sir

I take great pleasure in giving you my present whereabouts for the benefit of the Scotland Yard Boys. I am very sorry that I did not have time to finish my work with the London whores and regret to state that I must leave them alone for a short while I am now safe in New York and will travel over to Philadelphia and when I have the lay of the locality I might take a notion to do a little ripping there. Good bye "dear friend" I will let you here from me before long with a little more Culling and Ripping I said 20 and I fancy I will make it 40 on account of the slight delay in operations

Yours lovingly

"Jack" 
the ripper
