I will write to you again soon / Just a card to let you know that I shall (if possible) do some more of my business in the West part of London & I hope to be able to send you my victims ears. I was not able to last time. My bloody ink is now running out so I must get some more. It amuses me that you think I am mad you will see when I am caught but it is death to the first man who touches me. It will be most probably the end of October or it may be before all depends Jack the Ripper
