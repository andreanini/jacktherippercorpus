I am very much amused at the description of myself in the paper. If you want a full description and a truthfull one, find the Good woman that took me across Hackney Common and through the Parks a fortnight ago. I had made up my mind to work that day on the first I met, we were in a dark place for it was foggy. But if I am the Devil I could not touch her. she is the only good woman I have met in England I told her I was Jack the Ripper and I took my hat off and she is the only one that has seen my face. I am the man you will have a hard job to find her, she was
going to work and had got her girl with her. I could have done mother & daughter easy, she was to good.
