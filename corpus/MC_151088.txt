Dear Sir, - If the Bradford Police would like to make another gallant capture now is the time. I have arrived in town for the purpose of doing a little business. Bradford is the field that requires my labour. Of course knowing as I do that your men are so clever it is not necessary to give my address nor yet describe myself minutely. I will simply state that I am here and alone quite near to the Town Hall.

I am, my dear sir, yours in the fight against wickedness.

J. Ripper

P.S. - Perhaps you would like my portrait, but you see I am in deep mourning for those ladies that I put to sleep, and do not wish to have one taken.
