Dear Sir

Take my advice and trouble yourself no more about me. Talk about having caught a "Jack the Ripper" at Bradford, why I'm all safe and sound its all bosh. If I was in your place I'd let my men search the different houses and alleys where if they looked they would find two more women which I killed & cut up before a bobby's nose. he was rather drunk. if I ketch any of your bloodhounds I'll kill and eat them them, wont you come and help me to kill a few women,
it's a jolly nice lark.

Yours

Jack the Ripper
