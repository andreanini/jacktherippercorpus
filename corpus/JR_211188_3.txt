Near the Spot

Nov 21/88.

Dear Boss 

Being still at large —thanks to the energetic efforts of the Police to effect my capture. I take the liberty of writing to you to say that it is my intention of committing one or two outrages & murders in or near your locality-perhaps on the steps of your office. I am not living far away from Cavendish Street, near your office. The reason of my writing this in ink instead of human
blood is that I was not fool enough to keep any from last jobs in Whitechapel.

Yours

Jack the Ripper
