Dear Boss I am still at liberty the last job was not bad in (Whitechapel) but I guess the next will be a (dam) sight worse the police about here are fine looking fellows I had the pleasure of drinking with one this morning and asked him what he thought about my glorious work I guess I will make a double shuffle of it this time me and my pal (you bet) I have got one or two set and soon shall have more (Ha_Ha_Ha) I can see better specimens in garrison town look out in a day or two yours (not yet) jack the Ripper (Ha,Ha)
