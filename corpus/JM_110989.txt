To clear up this matter re the whitechapel murders. no doubt you think [ ]vious that [I]am not cought. but I must confess I was as nere cought this morning as possible. PC passed me while i was carring my deadly parcel to the arch off cable st or nere their.

I must one I am fortunate to eskape the law so long but I have sworn to kill fifteen wimmans in
Whitechapel and bye Gods help so I will. I can tell you I am miserable as one can be and shall be glad when my bloody worke is over as I find it is reccherd at nite to sleep I have some dredfull dreames I do not care if i am cought or no. now I am in london I will remain till I finished my work. I bought a paper this morning red the news and wished I was ded.
