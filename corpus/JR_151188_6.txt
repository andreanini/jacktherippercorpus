Dear Boss

I gave you warning that I would clip the lady's ears off, grand work it was, Had plenty of time. finished her straight off. Shall not keep you waiting long. Will try & clear, 3 woman next time. I shall snap the fingers & toes off next time. My knife is a treat. But where are the Bloodhounds? Curse the Red Stuff it clogs so thick on me good bye till you hear from me again
