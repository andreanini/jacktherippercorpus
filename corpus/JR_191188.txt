Dear Boss

The police officers 'ave not caught me yet How can they when I am used to police work. I shall [k]eep on ripping whores till [I] do get buckled. I want to get to work right away if I get a chance and will do another one indoors. The last job was a grand one It took me a long time to do. My knifes so nice and I shall take the next ladys scalp. You will hear of my funny little games again on Friday night Good luck

Yours truly

Jack the Ripper
