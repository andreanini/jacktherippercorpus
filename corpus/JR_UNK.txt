Dear Boss

I am writing to let you know although I have not done what I intended to do on the 9th could not get a chance as the people in Clapham are too wideawake as yet but I mean to carry out my threat sooner or later I am in Clapham now as you will see but what hart you will have to find out if the people here only new who I was they would shiver in their shoes I now come to a close with this old Snuff

Yours in Haste
