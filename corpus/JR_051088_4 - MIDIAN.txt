Dear Friend

In the name of God hear me I swear I did not kill the female whose body was found at Whitehall, If she was an honest woman I will hunt down and destroy
Her murderer. If she was a whore God will bless the hand that slew her, for the women of of Moab and Midian shall die and their blood shall mingle with the dust. I never harm any others or the Divine power that protects and helps me in my grand work would quit for ever. Do as I do and the light of glory shall shine upon you. I must get to work tomorrow treble event this time  yes yes three must be ripped . will send you a bit of face by post I promise this dear old Boss . The police
now reckon my work a practical joke, well well Jacky's a very practical joker ha ha ha Keep this back till three are wiped out and you can show the cold meat

Yours truly

Jack the Ripper
