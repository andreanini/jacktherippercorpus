To the chief of Scotland Yd.

I might say that none of the police are on or have been on my track. I will D.V. commit another murder on the 9 instant. The last murder was not done by me but by some one else.

Jack the Ripper

I do not wish to waste a stamp to such useless Dogs as you detectives
