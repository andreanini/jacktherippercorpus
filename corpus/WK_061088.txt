Dear Sir

I don't think I do enough murders so shall not only do them in Whitechapel but in Brixton, Battersea & Clapham. If I cant get enough women to do I shall cut up men, boys & girls. Just to keep my hand in practice. Ha! ha! You will never find me in Whitechapel. By the discription in the papers 5 ft 7 inches is all wrong. Ha! Ha. I expect to rip up a woman or to on the Common at Clapham Junction one day
turn next week. Ha.ha.ha. I will send you the heart by pacels post.

Ha!Ha!
