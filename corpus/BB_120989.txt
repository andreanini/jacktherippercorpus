Sir,

... excuse me [missing] writing to vou [missing] boldly, but [missing] intended to settle 4 more 2 in the east end, & 1 at Islington & 1, at West end near Regent St- some time next week for I have not got the right cow yet, I have sworn to catch the right one that as Injured me, I did not settle that one under arch way, but I know who did. I am not Jack the riper, as it is put about, I am Brumigan Bill the Slaughterman for they are all Brumigan Women, that I have settled for they have ruined many a honest man in their own native town, and have come to Injure honest men here but I intend to stop there little game
