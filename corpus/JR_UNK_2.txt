Jack the Ripper 

I am on your track you are my next victim. The one who I am going to murder next will live in City Road. I will do the murder in a empty house down one of the Back turnings I live in the City road the number his from 50 to 60. I will give her beans she shall have worst the others I will take away her liver 

Yours truly,

Jack the Ripper
