Dear Boss

Since last splendid success . two more & never a squeal. oh I am master of the art. I am going to be heavy on the guilded whores now, we are . some dutchess will cut up nicely & the lace will show nicely. You wonder how ! oh we are masters no education like a butchers no animal like a nice woman . the fat are best On to Brighton for a holiday but we shant idle splendid high class women there my mouth waters . Good luck there . If not you will hear from me in West End . My pal will keep on at the east a while yet . When I get a nobility womb I will send it on to C. Warren or perhaps to you for a keepsake 
O it is jolly .
