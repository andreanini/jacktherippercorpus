Dear Boss Was not that jolly at scare about that woman who thought that Jack the Ripper. They think they have got hold of my description I laughed myself into fits over that I have got a jolly lot of false whiskers & moustachios in my black bag. The last job was nice & clean. I carried away a part of her. (Conundrum Try & find what part). I am going to do another on Friday. & I shall give the police enough running about on Christmas. Jack the Ripper
