Dear Boss

I am still knocking about Down Whitechapel I mean to put to Death all the dirty old ores because I have cought the pox and cannot piss I have not done any murders lately but you will find one done before long. I shall send you the kidney and cunt so that you can see where my prick has been up I am in one of the lodging houses in Osborn street but you will have a job to catch me I shoudent advise any coppers to catch hold of me because I shall do the same to him as I have done others. Old packer the man I bought the grapes off saw me the other night but was to frighten to say anything to the police. he must have been a fool when there is such a reward offered never mind the reward will not be given. You will hear from me a little later on that I have done
another murder. But not just yet. Dear Boss if I see you about I shall cut your throat. The Old Queen is none but one of those old ores I have Been up her arse and shot sponk up her

I remain Dear
Old Boss
