Somers Town

DEAR BOSS,

I am very sorry I have given you all the trouble I have, but my thirst for blood must be satisfied, when I have slaughtered 6 more I shall give myself up to your dogs, before this month is gone you will hear of me again, this time it shall be Kings Cross where a few of the whores want thinning. Boss your dogs are too hot for me at Whitechapel or I should have done the rest there, the man who catches me will be a clever one, and will have to fight very hard for the reward offered. I am now living in Somers Town, but I must not tell you my address.

I remain

Dear Boss

Your truly

"Jack the Ripper"

P.S. please excuse the writing, you shall hear from me again!
