From Jack the Ripper
Wednesday 10/1889

Dear Bos
Just a few lines before-hand I warn you to be on your guard. I mean to begin again with more determination. Oh how I crack my sides with laughing when I read of dear Old Jack and to think the Shiny button are baffled. I must say you are clever in finding out things you are quite perfect. I am a Student and I have been employed at one of the largest Hospitals in London. I am a French man by birth but through reduce circumstances and partly by English Woman I have been brought to poverty and oblige to take refuge in Whitechaple revenge is sweet so the Englishman say and I mean to have it I mean to do 20 and then I mean to give myself up. That last one was a devilish tuff one the knife had to be sharpened up a great many times you are quite right I did do it in a house were she lived and took me home I gave one of her ears to a passing dog so if you find the other parts you will not find the Ear the Poor old Sailor you mention in the Paper gave a grunt while I was devilish

P.S. I am leaving the [illegible] of Whitechapel excuse blunder I scarcely know what I am doing Jack depositing the bag that nearly made me Jump out of my boots poor Old chap how sad to be taken for Jack the Ripper I glory in it keep your spirits up dear Bos and be on your guard all though this as been written with a beating heart and a Shakey hand its from Dear Old Jack who wish you luck.
