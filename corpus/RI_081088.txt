Dear Boss,

I have to thank you and my Brother in trade, Jack the Ripper for your kindness in letting me away out of Whitechapel I am on my road to the tweed Factories I will let the Innerleithen Constable or Police men know when I am about to start my nice Little games. I have got my knife Replenished so it will answer both for Ladies and Gents Other 5 Tweed ones and I have one my wager

I am Yours

Truly

The Ripper
