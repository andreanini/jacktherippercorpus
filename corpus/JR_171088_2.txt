Dear Parkin,

Having not seen you for a long time I'm coming to see you, getting tired of Whitechapel I thought it best to give this town a turn and I think you will suit my purpose a treat meet me at Thornton Heath Friday night at 8 oclock if you fail you will be a dead un. Beware

Yours Truly

Jack the Ripper
