You though your-self very clever I reckon when you informed the police But you made a mistake, if you though I dident see you now I know you know me and I see your little game, and I mean to finish you and send your ears to your wife if you show this to the police or help them if you do I will finish you. It no use your trying to get out of my way Because I have you when you don't expect it and I keep my word as you soon see and rip you up

Yours truly Jack the Ripper
