Dear Boss,

Just a few lines to you to tell I am stopping near Glos'ter for a few days I intend waiting here till the last affair is blown over and then may return on another visit to to Whitechapel dont you think I'm having a good Grinn abbout the man with the black moustache; ha ; ha ;
Dear Boss: tell the Glostorins not to be to much alarmed as I dont feel up to having a game with them at present;

I remain yours

faithfuly Jack
