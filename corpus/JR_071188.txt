Dear Boss

I am writing you this while I am in bed with a sore throat but as soon as it is better I will set to work again on the 13th of this month . and I think that my next Job will be to polish you off and as I am a member of the force I can soon settle accounts with you I will tear your liver out before you are dead and show it to you and I will have your kidneys out also and frie them with pepper and salt and send them to lord Sablisbrury as it is Just the sort of thing that will suit that old Jew and I will cut of your toes and slick of your behind and make macaroni soup of them and I will hide your body in the houses of parliament so you grey headed old pig say your prayers before I am ready
