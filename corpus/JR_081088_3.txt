I am as you see by this note amongst the slogging town of Brum and mean to play my part well & vigorously amongst its inhabitants I have already spotted from its number 3 girls and before one week is passed after receiving this 3 Families will be thrown into a state of delightful mourning. Ha. Ha. My Bloody whim must have its way do not be surprised 15 murders must be completed then I kill myself to cheat the scaffold. For I know you cannot catch me & may I be even present in your dreams
