Dear Boss

You have not caught me yet you see, with all your cunning, with all your "tecs" with all your blue bottles. I have made two narrow squeaks this week, but still thogh disturbed I got clear before I could get to work - I will give the foreigners a run now I think - for a change - Germans especially if I can - I was conversing with two or three of your men last night - their eyes of course were shut & thus they Did not see my bag. 

Ask any of your men who were on duty last night in Piccadilly (Circus End) last night if they saw a gentleman put 2 dragoon guard sergeants into a hansom. I was close by & heard him talk about shedding blood in Egypt. I will soon shed more in England.

I hope you read mark & learn all that you can if you do so you may & may not catch Jack the Ripper If you want to know where Jack the Ripper is Ask a policeman So long old boys au revoir somday I shall meet you again ha ha ha

Your old friend (the enemy)

Jack
