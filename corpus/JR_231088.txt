Dear Sirs

I Jack the Ripper thanks you for your trouble in trying to catch me, but it wont do.

I suppose you would like to know why I am killing so many women, the answer is simply this. "When I was at San Francisco in July, 1888, I lent three women from London about £100 sterling to pay some debts. they had got into, promising to pay me back in a months time, and seeing that they had a ladylike look I lent the money. Well when the month passed by I asked for my money but I
found that they had sneaked off to London so I swore that I would have my revenge, the revenge was this. that I would go to London and kill as many women as possible. I've killed 9 as yet. you've not found all the corpses yet. Ha. Ha. I've told Sir C. Warren that in a letter of the 22nd inst. In the last women I killed cut out the kidneys and eat them, you'ill find the body in one of the sewers in the East End. The leg you found at Whitehall does not belong to the trunk you found there. The police alias po-lice, think themselves devilish clever I suppose they'ill never catch me at this rate you donkeys, you double-faced asses, you had better take the blood-hounds away or I will kill them. I am on the scent of those women that swindled me so basely, living like well to do ladies on the money they sneaked from me, never mind, that, I'll have em yet, afore I'm done, damn em, To tell you the truth you ought to be obliged to me for killing such a deuced lot of vermin, why they are ten times worse than men.

I remain. etc.
